## Features

* **Customizable Buttons:** Add, edit, and delete buttons with custom text, link URLs, and colors.
* **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Organize your buttons by dragging and dropping them.
* **Title Customization:** Edit the homepage title directly from the UI.
* **Save & Load Configuration:** Export your configuration to a JSON file for backup or use on another device.
* **Cross-Device Access:** Easily access your homepage configuration from any device by saving it to Box Drive, Dropbox, or Google Drive.

## Quick Start

To get started quickly, simply **click the link to `my-homepage.html` in the GitHub repository** ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/pbeens/LinkHub)).

1. Click on `my-homepage.html` in the list of files.
2. Click the **Download Raw File** icon in the top-right corner of the File Preview window.

That's it! The file will be saved locally to your computer. You can now open the `my-homepage.html` file directly in your browser and start adding, editing, and organizing your buttons.

### Setting as Your Browser Homepage

Once you have configured LinkHub, save the `my-homepage.html` file in a convenient location, like Box Drive, Dropbox, or Google Drive. This allows you to set it as your browser's homepage on any computer with access to these services.

* **Chrome:** Go to Settings ‚Üí On Startup ‚Üí Open a specific page ‚Üí Add a new page ‚Üí Enter the file path or cloud link.
* **Firefox:** Go to Settings ‚Üí Home ‚Üí Homepage and new windows ‚Üí Enter the file path or cloud link.
* **Edge:** Go to Settings ‚Üí Start, home, and new tabs ‚Üí Open these pages ‚Üí Add a new page ‚Üí Enter the file path or cloud link.

If using a cloud service, make sure the path is accessible, and you are signed in on each computer.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution When Updating

**Important:** If you decide to update `my-homepage.html` by downloading a new version from the repository, it will contain the **default `default.json` settings**. This means that your current button configuration will be **overwritten**.

To avoid losing your personalized setup:

1. **Save your current configuration** by clicking `Save Configuration` before updating.
2. After updating `my-homepage.html`, **load your saved configuration** by clicking `Load Configuration` and selecting your saved JSON file.

This ensures your buttons and settings remain exactly as you left them.

## Advanced Installation (Optional)

If you wish to **modify the code** or **contribute to the project**, you can clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pbeens/LinkHub.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd LinkHub
```

Open the `my-homepage.html` file in your preferred browser:

```bash
open my-homepage.html
```

## Configuration File

The configuration is stored in a JSON format. A sample configuration (`default.json`) is included:

```json
{
    "title": "My Homepage",
    "buttons": [
        {
            "text": "Google Search",
            "link": "https://www.google.com",
            "color": "Blue"
        },
        {
            "text": "Bing Search",
            "link": "https://www.bing.com",
            "color": "Green"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Note:** The configuration is saved automatically within the browser's local storage. If you want to maintain a backup or move to another device, be sure to click `Save Configuration` and store the JSON file in a safe location like Box Drive, Dropbox, or Google Drive.
